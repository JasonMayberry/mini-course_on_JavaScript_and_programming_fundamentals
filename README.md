# mini-course_on_JavaScript_and_programming_fundamentals

# Up to the Events section of this video I was able to lump all of the sample code into one large document.
# At the beginning of the Events section and then on through the Form section I had to create separate 
# documents for each sample of code.  
# I could not find anywhere that had the original sample code downloadable, so I thought I would make 
# this available after having followed along with this tutorial.
